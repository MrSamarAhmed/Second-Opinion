# Second Opinion — a Qloo recommendation evidence auditor

Qloo returns a ranked list of artists for a seed artist, each with an affinity
score. This tool answers a narrower question about each of those
recommendations: **is the recommendation backed by descriptive metadata that can
be pointed at, or is affinity the only thing there?**

For every candidate it shows four dimension receipts — genres, lyrical themes,
audience, style — each with the exact source field in the payload returned for
that audit, the shared terms, and an overlap coefficient. It then emits one
discrete state:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CORROBORATED` | At least 2 of 4 dimensions meet the 0.30 threshold. |
| `AFFINITY_ONLY` | Affinity exists, but fewer than 2 dimensions meet the threshold. |
| `UNVERIFIABLE` | A precondition is missing: no seed/candidate metadata, no affinity, fewer than 2 comparable dimensions, or a receipt that failed re-derivation. |

Before any result is shown, the agent re-derives every receipt from the payload
returned for that audit. A receipt that cannot be reproduced voids that
candidate's audit.

**What this does not do.** It does not score recommendation quality, does not
produce a composite number, and does not claim that shared tags mean shared
fans, demand, attendance, ticket sales or revenue. It audits whether Qloo's own
descriptive metadata supports a pair, nothing more.

## Quick start

Python 3.9+, standard library only. No installation step.

```bash
python3 -m second_opinion.server          # http://localhost:8000
PORT=9000 python3 -m second_opinion.server
```

Command line:

```bash
python3 -m second_opinion.cli seeds
python3 -m second_opinion.cli audit "Fontaines D.C."
python3 -m second_opinion.cli audit "Bad Bunny" --json --threshold 0.30
```

## Modes

**Live mode** is the default. It calls the Qloo API using `QLOO_API_KEY`. A
directly launched server or CLI also loads the project-root `.env`, but a real
environment variable always takes precedence over the file value. The loader
never prints, logs, returns, or stores credential values.

```bash
python3 -m second_opinion.server                       # reads ./.env, http://localhost:8000
python3 -m second_opinion.cli audit "Fontaines D.C."   # live by default
export QLOO_API_KEY=...                                # or export it; overrides ./.env
```

Docker images do not contain `.env`; a container receives the key at runtime,
either from the platform's secret store or from a local `--env-file` command.
The key must never be baked into an image or passed as a build argument.

**Fixture mode** (`SO_MODE=fixture`, or `--mode fixture` on the CLI) reads saved
responses from a local `data/fixtures/` directory. That directory is intentionally
not present in this clean publication copy. The fixture tests skip when it is
absent, and live mode never silently falls back to fixtures. With no key,
`/api/audit` returns HTTP 503.

## Seed catalogue

`second_opinion/catalog.py` contains eight hand-written artist search names and
a short editorial note for each. The public seed list contains no entity IDs,
tag counts, affinities, or captured payloads. Selecting a seed sends the name to
`/api/audit`, which resolves it through `GET /search` and audits the live
recommendation set through `GET /v2/insights`.

The live request path is:

```text
GET /search           query, types=urn:entity:artist, take
GET /v2/insights      filter.type, filter.results.entities for the seed record
GET /v2/insights      filter.type, signal.interests.entities, take for candidates
X-Api-Key             credential header
```

The seed record is fetched by `filter.results.entities` and checked against the
resolved entity ID. This is necessary because `signal.interests.entities`
returns recommendations, not the seed itself.

## Failure behavior

| Condition | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| No `QLOO_API_KEY` | HTTP 503; the response names `QLOO_API_KEY` but never a credential value |
| Credential rejected | refusal code `authentication failed` |
| Request timeout | refusal code `upstream timeout` |
| Non-JSON response | `MalformedResponse`, surfaced as a refusal or HTTP 502 |
| No search match | refusal code `seed resolution failed` |
| Seed has no usable scored metadata | refusal code `insufficient seed metadata` |
| Receipt cannot be re-derived | candidate state becomes `UNVERIFIABLE` and the audit is void for that candidate |

## Method

The four scored dimensions are:

| Dimension | Source fields |
| --- | --- |
| genres | `properties.primary_genres[]` + `properties.secondary_genres[]` |
| themes | `properties.lyrical_themes[]`, falling back to `tags[type=urn:tag:theme:qloo].name` |
| audience | `tags[type=urn:tag:audience:qloo].name` |
| style | `tags[type=urn:tag:style:qloo].name` |

`properties.instruments` and `properties.influenced_by` are display-only. They
are not scored because they can be non-discriminative or too sparse to compare.

Normalization is deterministic and spelling-only: Unicode NFKD with combining
marks removed, lowercase, `&` → `and`, `/`, `-`, `_` → space, drop remaining
punctuation, collapse whitespace. No stemming, no stopwords, no synonyms.

Comparison is the overlap coefficient:

```text
|A ∩ B| / min(|A|, |B|)
```

over normalized, de-duplicated sets. Jaccard was rejected because it penalizes
an entity for having a richer metadata entry rather than measuring the
relationship itself.

The decision rule is a pure function over dimension statuses. The frozen
thresholds are in `second_opinion/config.py`: strong overlap 0.30, at least two
evaluable dimensions, and at least two corroborated dimensions for
`CORROBORATED`.

## Blanket dimensions

A dimension that corroborates for every candidate in a seed result is not
discriminating within that result set. `/api/audit` reports this with
`dimension_summary.<dimension>.is_blanket`, and the UI exposes it instead of
hiding it. This rule is retained even when live results look favorable.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
```

Verified suite:

| Environment | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Full local development workspace | 142 tests OK, 0 skips, exit code 0 |
| Clean publication copy without `data/`, `.env`, or captured fixtures | 142 tests OK, 57 skipped, exit code 0 |

The 57 skips are all fixture-dependent tests. Their reason is:

```text
captured Qloo fixtures are not present in this checkout
```

Coverage includes receipt re-derivation, fabricated shared terms, normalization,
duplicate collapse, audit states and boundaries, live adapter error mapping,
key-header behavior, secret non-disclosure, static seed catalogue behavior,
mode handling, `.env` loader precedence, and clean-checkout HTTP routes.

## Deployment

**Not deployed.** No public URL exists from this clean-copy preparation. The
included `Dockerfile` is intended to be used by a container host with a runtime
secret. The exact steps are in [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Qloo data-use note

Captured Qloo responses, local reports, stale clean-checkout exports, entity
IDs, and detailed live audit outputs are intentionally absent from this
publication copy.

Some tests use synthetic entity IDs instead of API-returned identifiers. The
hand-authored artist names are search inputs, not published entity IDs. However,
Qloo's binding API terms and data-retention terms should be reviewed before
publishing any API response content, derived metrics, saved fixtures, or
entity-specific analyses. This repository copy does not assert that
redistribution permission has been established.

## Limitations

- The tool audits metadata overlap only. It does not audit audience overlap,
  demand, commercial performance, or recommendation quality.
- Metadata coverage is uneven; where a dimension is missing on either side, the
  receipt is `unverifiable` and the limitation names the dimension.
- Affinity values are displayed as returned by Qloo; the auditor does not
  recompute or reinterpret them.
- A live audit depends on an operator-provided `QLOO_API_KEY` and on the current
  Qloo API behavior.
- The clean-copy audit verifies local no-key behavior, not a hosted deployment.
